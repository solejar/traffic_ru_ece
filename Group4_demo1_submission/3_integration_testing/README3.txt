Our integration testing can be run by going to http://onwardtraffic.com/php/integration_test.php. 

This will display the result of the integration_test.php file. This integration file generates every possible permutation of execution paths, and runs the controller script through every one of them. Then, the output of the controller is compared to the expected output.
