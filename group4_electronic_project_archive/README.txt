Running our software:
	
	The best way to run our software is to go directly to our website, onwardtraffic.com. Once on this webpage, you can click on the route or heatmap feature and run them. When running the route feature and filling in the address parameters, please specify both a location and city name. For example, you can say "Time Square New York" or "Easton Ave New Brunswick NJ". Data was only collected for the tri-state area, so limit your address and zip code parameters to those within this bounding box.

	If you wish to compile the code and build a runnable file on a local machine, it is required that you have MySQL server, PHP5 with mySQL libraries, Apache2 web server. Once you have all of these servers, you can open any index.php file on a browser.

	If you wish to host our files when we no longer use our onwardtraffic.com domain, you can find any hosting service that supports MySQL and PHP5. Then upload the files to your server using a FTP such as filezilla. 

	Additionally, you will need to set up your own SQL database and change the connection in the php files to your own database. A csv and SQL version of each data table we created has been provided. The data tables are: bounds, severity, grid, traffic_data, and frequency.
